# NMR-Lab-Analysis

When running an quantum algorithms on an NMR spectrometer it is important to firslty simulate the results and then quickly anaylse your data to ensure it matches your expectations. This repository is designed to speed this process.

I'd recommend testing out a few gates before launching into running the algorithms. To do this use the file 'NMR spectrum simulator' to test you have properly calbrated the spectromter and are getting the expected results. To simulate the expected results of the algorithms, use the file 'Quantum Algorithms on 2 qubit Chloroform'. 

To analyse the results of the NMR spectrometer use the 'Analysis of Spectrum' file which returns the deconstructed density matrix from raw NMR spectra.
